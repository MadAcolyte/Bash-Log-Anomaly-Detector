# Bash Log Anomaly Detector

## Purpose
This script was created as a university project to learn Bash scripting. The cybersecurity focus was my own initiative to extend the project and explore attack patterns in real server logs. 
It reads a server log file and detects patterns that may indicate unauthorized access attempts or malicious requests.

## Key Functions
- Extracts and lists unique IPv4 addresses found in the log
- Counts events generated by each IP
- Detects suspicious activity based on common SSH login failures
- Detects repeated HTTP error responses that may indicate brute-force attempts
- Searches for simple indicators of web attacks (SQLi, XSS, path traversal)
- Allows exporting suspicious log lines to a new file

## Technical Details
- Written in Bash and uses AWK for text parsing
- Includes file validation and safe runtime settings (`set -euo pipefail`, secure `IFS`)
- Supports interactive menu mode for exploring log results
- Demonstrates basic pattern matching and parameter handling

## Additional information
Includes a sample log file (server.log) for testing the script

## Usage
```bash
./anomaly_detector.sh /path/to/server.log
